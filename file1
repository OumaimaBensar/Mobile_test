One of the most commonly used commands in GitHub is git clone. This command is used to create a local copy of a remote repository on your computer. Here's a brief explanation:

git clone <repository_url>: It creates a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine, allowing you to work on the project, make changes, and contribute back to the repository.
It's a fundamental command for collaborating on open-source projects, working with your own repositories, or starting new development tasks.
